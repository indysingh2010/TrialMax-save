The source rectangle is always the image itself.

The destination rectangle and client window rectangle work together to 
present a view of the source image.

To view the whole image in the client window, the width and height of the
destination rectangle should match the client window.

To zoom in on the image you have to make the destination rectangle larger
than the client window. Think of the destination rectangle as an enlarged
version of the source image and the client window as being a window moving
around on top of the destination rectangle.

To view a particular region of the source image, scale the destination up
such that the width of the desired region just will fit in the client 
window. See CTMLead::ResizeViewToSrc()

To line up on the desired region after scaling the destination to the
appropriate size, imagine holding the client window in position while
you grab the upper left corner of the destination rectangle and pull 
it to the upper left. Stop pulling when the upper left corner of the
desired region coincides with the upper left corner of the client
window - this is why the destination left/top coordinates are always
less than or equal to zero.

Formulas:

Visible Source Width = ClientWndWidth * (BitmapSrcWidth / DstWidth)
Visible Source Height = ClientWndHeight * (BitmapSrcHeight / DstHeight)
