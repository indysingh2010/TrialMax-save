1. New bitmaps were created in order to add Nudge Left, Nudge Right and Save Nudge Button in both Presentation Toolbar(Tblarge,Tbmedium,Tbsmall,Tdlarge,Tdmedium,Tdsmall) and Manager Toolbar(Mediabar.bmp).
2. Tblarge.psd, Tbmedium.psd, Tbsmall.psd, Tdlarge.psd, Tdmedium.psd, Tdsmall.psd were created by Noman Qureshi and Gull Samreen. When creating bitmaps, a pink border appears around the new icons.
3. Tblarge-Amyn.psd, Tbmedium-Amyn.psd, Tbsmall-Amyn.psd, Tdlarge-Amyn.psd, Tdmedium-Amyn.psd, Tdsmall-Amyn.psd were created by Amyn. These were modified versions of the above PSD's in order to remove the pink border.
4. The final bitmaps that were included in Trialmax were the ones created from the PSD's from Point 3 above.
5. If more icons need to be added in the future, use these PSD's and create new bitmaps accordingly.


Update 7/3/2017:

6. New bitmap of adjustable callout was created by faheem magsi.Previously, there were 84 bitmaps on the MediaBar.bmp strip and with a button width of 84, the total width of the bitmap strip was 2016. Now, after the 85th bitmap is added, the width has been updated to 2040 (85*24). When adding new buttons to the MediaBar.bmp in the future, please make sure to keep the width equal to the width of one button multipled by total buttons on the strip or else trialmax will start throwing exceptions.
